# Image-and-Slideshow-Using-React
In this project I implement a simple frontend webpage using React.

The project consists of:
1. An image gallery which enlarges when mouse hovers over an image.
2. A menu for routing to different pages.
3. A slideshow page, in which users can adjust the speed of the slideshow.
